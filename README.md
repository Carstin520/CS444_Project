 In this project, we present the successful implementation of the framework introduced by the paper "Self-Supervised Image Restoration with Blurry and Noisy Pairs‚Äù by Zhang et al. Our efforts involved replicating the automated de-blur and de-noise learning model and making evaluations on real-world and motion-involved image datasets. With the Python and PyTorch techniques we learned from class CS444, our implementation demonstrated the model's adaptability to different levels of noise and blur. After reviewing some of the state-of-the-art methods, we took advantage of the insights we acquired from those methods to improve the performance of our recreated model. With some pre-trained models, clear instructions, and a well-organized dataset structure to study with, our work offers a reproducible approach for the image restoration research industry.
